b) Introduction<br>
In today's volatile stock market, predicting price movements is crucial for investors to make informed decisions. This model aims to forecast whether a stock's closing price will rise or fall compared to the previous day, using key metrics like opening price, high, low, and volume. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data, our model provides valuable insights to guide investment strategies.<br>
**Problem Statement** The goal is to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a stock's closing price will increase (1) or decrease (0) relative to the preceding day based on its opening, high, low, and volume metrics.<br>
**Data and Methodology** We preprocess historical stock data, focusing on relevant features such as opening price, daily high and low, and trading volume. XGBoost, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, is employed for modeling due to its effectiveness in classification tasks.<br>
**Model Development** The dataset, primarily from Tesla, is split into training and testing sets. Following model training, performance evaluation is conducted using accuracy and F1-score metrics to assess predictive effectiveness.<br>
**Results and Evaluation** Visualizing predicted versus actual labels provides insights into model performance, demonstrating its ability to predict stock price movements accurately.<br> **Conclusion** Our model offers a robust solution for predicting stock price movements, empowering investors with data-driven insights to navigate market uncertainties confidently.
